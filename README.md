# Importance of identifying design properties of a mock up design
Identifying the design properties of a mockup is an essential part of turning a visual idea into working code. Whether you're coding from a Figma file, Dribbble shot, or sketch from a client, knowing what to look for in the design saves time, avoids confusion, and leads to clean, accurate implementations.
